Use at your own discretion and if you know how to.....


But to be honest its really very simple.

All the aliases and functions are commands that can be run from the terminal.

Just source the files in your bashrc or bash_profile something like......

source ./.aliases

source ./.macos

and restart your terminal process

all these work when you put these files in your hom edirectory or cd to it.

Description for all the fuctions and settings are given.

Thanks to Mathias Bynens for the inspiration.
Go to his git to get the full list and be carefull since some of them can really mess up your system.
